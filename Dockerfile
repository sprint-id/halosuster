FROM golang:1.22 as builder

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed
RUN go mod download

# Copy everything from the current directory to the PWD(Present Working Directory) inside the container
COPY . .

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

# WORKDIR /root/
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Pre-built binary file from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Ensure the binary is executable
RUN chmod +x main

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
